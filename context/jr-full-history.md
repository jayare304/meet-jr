- **Role:** Audience Strategy (gravitated there naturally)
- **What:** Israeli startup doing incredibly ahead-of-its-time work in RTB (before it was called "programmatic")
- **Key insight:** "The market just wasn't ready for what they were doing. If this startup had come along two, three years later, they would have been wildly successful. Timing is everything."
- **Why it matters:** First legitimate advertising job. Learned to love the data side - building personas, evaluating data vendor methodology, deploying audiences across programmatic campaigns.

### Xaxis (2013-2020)

- **Company:** Part of GroupM, part of WPP
- **Progression:** Senior Audience Strategist → Strategy Director → VP of Strategy → SVP of Product & Strategy
- **What he did:**

  - Tons of new business pitches
  - Won Ford business (2016-2017): Year-long sales process, ~$90M in managed media spend
  - Created Headlight organization (still exists today)

### Triad (2017-2020, overlapping with Xaxis)
- **Location:** FL / NY
- **Context:** Xaxis purchased Triad. JR was the liaison - "trusted company man" overseeing the acquisition, reporting back to mothership.
- **What he built:** Retail Response - media product allowing programmatic buyers to target based on where people shopped. Got ~$2M+ in revenue.
- **Exit:** Left when Walmart fired Triad. "Writing was on the wall."

### Back to Xaxis (~2020)
- **Role:** SVP of Product & Strategy
- **What:** Oversaw audience strategies + product business

### Citrus Ad (Dec 2020 - Aug 2021)
- **Location:** ?
- **Role:** VP, Agency Strategy
- **Duration:** 8 months
- **What happened:** Wanted to get back into retail media. Was sold on being able to build things with agencies. First 4 months figuring things out, next 4 months getting blocked everywhere. Turned out company was being acquired by Publicis.
- **Why he left:** "Hated it." Didn't want to manage agency relationships. Wasn't able to build.

### Gopuff (Sept 2022 - Present)
- **Location:** NYC Metro (Rutherford, NJ)
- **Company context:** Gopuff is "notoriously stingy with titles" - Director there = bigger title elsewhere
- **Why he joined:** Wanted to work at a retailer, specifically a smaller one to get visibility into merchandising, supply chain, analytics, field operations. Didn't care what the job was initially.
- **Progression:** Regular sales job → Sr. Client Partner → Sr. Manager, Partnerships → Director, AdTech & Data Partnerships

#### Primary KPI: Data Monetization
- **Starting point:** ~$3M when he took over (Sept 2022)
- **2023:** $13.5M
- **2024:** $14.5M
- **2025:** $14.8M
- **5x growth** from where it started

#### What the job actually involves:
- Take all Gopuff/BevMo data and monetize it
- Sell to: suppliers, retail stores, media agencies, various buyers
- Find companies, negotiate deals (exclusive vs non-exclusive), manage relationships
- No handoff to account managers - he sells it, owns it, manages it
- Develops validation/verification processes
- Gets internal resources aligned

#### Largest deal: $7M annually

#### Ad Tech Partnerships (the other part):
- Meta, Google, Trade Desk, StackAdapt, Rokt, Disco
- These are retail media providers that power Gopuff's media products

#### Revenue ownership:
- 60% of department revenue = data monetization (his direct number)
- Other 40% = 90% runs through partnerships he manages
- Effectively touches almost all department revenue

#### Key skill - Finding emerging partners:
- Gopuff in cost-savings mode, needs aggressive deals
- Finds companies that are flexible, trying to build their business
- Signs them early, helps put them on the map, gets insane rates
- **Koddi:** Signed them → they went on to sign Best Buy
- **Seek:** Nobody had heard of them (everyone used IRI/Nielsen/Circana) → they signed Fanatics, Doordash

#### Also doing:
- Product strategy for Gopuff media products (driven by partnerships)
- RFI/RFP process (selected Koddi as ad server)
- One direct report (very junior)

## AI Work (April 2025 - Present)

### The Pivot
- More energized building than selling
- Saw the gap between what AI tools could do and what companies were actually doing
- Wants to help others build, not just build for himself

### Hours
- ~1,700 hours over 10 months
- ~40 hrs/week alongside full-time job

### Work Agents (Gopuff)
- Built "go agent" setup through Chow Chow
- 16 agents (T1, etc.)
- Set up through a series of inboxes
- P1 = Gemini agents (company allows Gemini, not Claude for work)
- Built RAG system for processing:
  - Emails
  - Slack messages
  - Meeting notes (transcripts or manual)
- Everything tied to: **People, Partners, Projects**
- Just finished agent-to-agent messaging
- Next: Slack integration

### Personal Projects
- **Peer/PeerOS:** Async agent system, where multi-model thinking began
- **HerdKit:** B2B platform for pet store operators, includes Henri (conversational AI)
- **ChowChow:** Electron app for managing multiple CLI agents, voice-to-agent
- **GoodKeep (formerly BabyBook):** Family memory-sharing iOS app. Built with a friend who had a baby. Needed a partner - doesn't like working alone.
- **JROS:** Personal knowledge management

### Protocols Developed
- **Triad Protocol:** Agent coordination
- **C1/C2/N1/N2 Framework:** Multi-agent orchestration
- **Rehydration Documents:** Context restoration (his term)

### Self-Identified Weakness
- Sub-agents: "I would almost rather have high-context [agents]... I think there's a way to do it without sub-agents"
- Acknowledges need to get better at this
- Notes Gemini deploying sub-agents more regularly

---

## Honest Self-Assessment

### What he's good at:
- Finding and closing complex partnership deals
- Identifying emerging vendors before they blow up
- Negotiating aggressive terms
- Building systems and products
- Understanding both business and technical sides
- Teaching/training others

### What he's bad at (his words):
- Moves fast, sometimes ships before polishing
- Better at building new things than maintaining old ones
- Learning to slow down when it matters
- Sub-agent architecture (prefers high-context agents)
